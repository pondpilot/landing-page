# Interactive SQL Blog Widget

Writing a blog post about data analysis? Don't just show the SQL — let readers run it. PondPilot Widget embeds a live SQL editor that turns passive readers into active explorers.

## Why Interactive SQL Posts Get More Engagement

A static SQL code block says "trust me, this works." An interactive widget says "try it yourself." Readers who can run and modify queries:

- Spend more time on your post
- Understand concepts deeper through experimentation
- Share posts more often (interactive content is memorable)

## How It Works

[PondPilot Widget](https://widget.pondpilot.io) is an embeddable SQL editor powered by DuckDB WASM. Add it to your blog post and readers get:

1. A pre-filled SQL query you wrote
2. A Run button
3. Results displayed inline
4. The ability to edit the query and re-run

All execution happens in the reader's browser. No server on your end.

## Perfect for Data Blog Posts

**"How I analyzed X dataset"** — Instead of screenshots of results, embed the actual queries. Readers can verify your analysis and explore the data themselves.

**SQL tutorials** — Each concept gets a runnable example. Readers learn by doing, not just reading.

**DuckDB tips and tricks** — Show off DuckDB's unique SQL features with interactive examples.

**Data journalism** — Present your findings with verifiable, runnable queries against the source data.

## Works with Any Blog Platform

Static HTML, Jekyll, Hugo, Ghost, Docusaurus, WordPress — if it renders HTML, PondPilot Widget works. It's a client-side JavaScript component with no server dependencies.

## Pre-Load Datasets

Seed each widget with the dataset for that section of your post. Readers see meaningful data immediately, not an empty editor.

## Free and Open Source

No API keys, no usage limits, no premium tier. PondPilot Widget is open source. Use it on as many posts as you want.
