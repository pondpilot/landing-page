## Personal Finance Analysis Made Simple

**Who**: Mike Perlov

**Problem**: Needed to analyze family dining expenses before making an important financial decision. Wanted to know frequency and average cost of dining out, but existing personal finance system didn't have the right reporting view.

**Solution**: Exported transaction data to Excel, opened it in PondPilot, and used AI integration to generate SQL for creating the needed pivot table with a single prompt.

**Result**: Got the exact analysis needed in under a minute instead of manual data crunching.
