We're excited to announce the release of PondPilot v0.2.0! A quick reminder: PondPilot is continuously updated at [app.pondpilot.io](https://app.pondpilot.io), but we occasionally mark major milestones so you can easily discover new features and improvements. Let's dive into the highlights of this release.

## What's New in v0.2.0

PondPilot v0.2.0 introduces significant enhancements to help you analyze and visualize your data more effectively:

</div>

### Key Highlights

There have been many improvements since v0.1.0, including a complete rework of how we handle data sources, allowing us to open multi-gigabyte files in milliseconds. Here are some highlights:

1. **Improved Performance**: PondPilot is now nearly as fast as the native DuckDB CLI and can open multi-gigabyte files instantly, making your data exploration experience much smoother.

2. **Script Sharing**: You can now share your SQL scripts with others via a simple URL, making it easy to collaborate with your team or share your work with the community.

3. **Automatic Data Refresh**: If a local file source is changed outside of PondPilot, the app will now behave like a true desktop application and transparently pick up the changes. *Note: There are still some limitations with this feature, but we are working on it.*

4. **Folder Support**: You can now add entire folders to PondPilot, and it will automatically include all the files inside, streamlining your workflow for projects with multiple data files.

5. **Full Multi-Tab State Support**: The app now feels like a true IDE, with tabs remembering their state between reloads and when switching between them.

6. **Query Editor Improvements**: The query editor now provides better auto-completion suggestions, including automatic quoting. Finally, you can safely and easily work with your favorite file called `my ðŸ¦†.csv`!

## What's Next

We are already working on the next version. Here are some features you can expect:

- **Query Editor Improvements**: We know the current query editor is far from perfect; we are working on bringing a full VS Code experience to PondPilot.

- **Persistent Database**: Soon, PondPilot will persist the managed internal DuckDB database across reloads, so you'll be able to maintain not just scripts and sources, but also temporary tables and other DuckDB objects.

- **New Export Formats**: More export formats are coming, including JSON, Parquet, and DuckDB.

- **New Remote Data Sources**: Multiple new data sources are coming, including remote DuckDB databases.
