Get ready for a breakthrough in data accessibility! [PondPilot](https://app.pondpilot.io) v0.6.0 is here, and it's our biggest step yet toward making data analysis truly universal. This release eliminates barriers and introduces features that will transform how you work with data, no matter your browser preference or workflow.

## üåç PondPilot Now Works Everywhere

The biggest news? **Universal browser support** is finally here! While PondPilot has always been lightning-fast in Chrome and Edge, we know not everyone lives in the Chromium world. Firefox and Safari users, this one's for you!

### Cross-Browser Magic ‚ú®

PondPilot now works seamlessly across **all major browsers**: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge. We've engineered a graceful experience that adapts to each browser's capabilities:

- **Chromium browsers** continue to get the full-powered experience with the File System Access API
- **Firefox and Safari users** get session-based file handling that's still incredibly smooth
- **Clear compatibility notifications** so you always know what to expect
- **No feature compromises** - just different (but equally effective) ways to handle your files

This means your team can use PondPilot regardless of their browser preferences, and you can access your data analysis tools from any device, anywhere.

## üìã Instant Data Import from Your Clipboard

Here's where things get really exciting: **clipboard data import**! This feature is an absolute game-changer for quick, ad-hoc data analysis.

### Copy, Paste, Analyze üöÄ

Imagine this scenario: you're reading a report, spot an interesting table, and want to quickly analyze it. With v0.6.0, the process is now ridiculously simple:

1. **Copy** any CSV or JSON data from anywhere (spreadsheets, websites, emails, documents)
2. **Paste** it directly into PondPilot 
3. **Configure** header detection for CSV files with our smart detection
4. **Start analyzing** immediately with full SQL power

No more saving temporary files, no more complex import wizards - just instant access to your data. Perfect for:
- Quick analysis of data from emails or documents
- Rapid prototyping with sample datasets
- Testing queries with small data snippets
- Ad-hoc analysis of copied tables from web pages

## üëÅÔ∏è Smarter File Exploration

We've also made exploring your data more efficient with **File Column Preview**. Now you can **Alt+Click** (Option+Click on Mac) on any file in your Files panel to instantly see its column structure without opening the file.

This means:
- **Faster data discovery** - understand your data structure at a glance
- **Better query planning** - know what columns are available before writing SQL
- **Reduced cognitive load** - no need to remember column names across multiple files

## üí¨ Error Messages That Actually Help

Nobody likes confusing error messages. That's why we've completely overhauled our notification system with **Enhanced Notifications**:

- **Clearer, more actionable error messages** that guide you toward solutions
- **No more duplicate information** in error titles  
- **Context-specific copy operations** so you always know what's happening
- **Better visual feedback** throughout the interface

## üéØ What's Coming Next

We're not slowing down! Already in development for the next release:

- **Enhanced query editor** with intelligent suggestions and better autocomplete
- **Improved data visualization capabilities** for richer insights
- **Performance optimizations** for even larger datasets
- **More export format options** to fit your workflow

## üöÄ Try It Now
