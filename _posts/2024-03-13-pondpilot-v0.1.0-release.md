We're thrilled to announce the first official release of PondPilot v0.1.0! After months of development and testing, we've reached this important milestone in our journey to provide a fast, secure, and easy-to-use data exploration tool powered by DuckDB.

## What's in v0.1.0

This release includes all the core functionality we've been working on, now stabilized and ready for regular use:

- **Complete SQL Query Interface**: Write and execute SQL queries against your data files with syntax highlighting and basic autocompletion
- **Multi-File Support**: Easily work with CSV, Parquet, JSON, and native DuckDB files
- **Data Grid View**: View query results in a responsive, sortable data grid
- **Export Capabilities**: Export query results to CSV with a single click
- **Session Persistence**: Your workspace state persists between browser sessions
- **100% Client-Side Processing**: All data processing happens locally - your data never leaves your device
