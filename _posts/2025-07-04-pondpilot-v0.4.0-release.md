We're excited to announce the release of [PondPilot](https://app.pondpilot.io) v0.4.0! This release brings some powerful productivity features that make working with your data smoother and more intuitive than ever before.

## 🎯 What's New in v0.4.0

### @-mentions for Smart Context 🧠

Say hello to one of our most requested features: **@-mentions**! You can now mention datasets, queries, and scripts directly in your AI prompts by typing `@` followed by the object name.

The magic happens when the AI assistant gets full context about the objects you're referencing. This means:

- More accurate SQL suggestions based on your actual data structure
- Better error fixes that understand your specific schema
- Contextual recommendations that know what you're working with

Simply type `@` in your prompt and watch the autocomplete magic happen!

### Unified Explorer Experience 🗂️

We've completely redesigned the file and database explorers into a single, cohesive interface. The new accordion-style sidebar brings together everything you need:

- **See databases within folders** - no more switching between different views
- **Navigate file systems and database schemas seamlessly** - one interface for everything
- **Improved filtering** with better visual feedback and smarter suggestions
- **Cleaner UI** with better spacing and more intuitive interactions

This unified approach means less clicking around and more time focusing on your data.

### Enhanced Autocomplete ⌨️

We've improved the coding experience with Tab key support for autocomplete suggestions. Just like your favorite IDE, you can now press Tab to accept suggestions quickly, making your workflow even more efficient.

### UI Polish & Stability 🎨

This release also includes several important improvements:

- **Better Dark Theme** - fixed various component issues for a more consistent visual experience
- **Improved Error Handling** - enhanced AI fix context management and connection pool stability
- **Cleaner Export Options** - streamlined CSV and TSV export interfaces

## 🎯 What's Coming Next

We're already hard at work on v0.5.0 with focus on stability and new connectivity options. Expect enhanced data source capabilities, better file handling, UI refinements, and improved offline functionality.

As always, we're building based on your feedback and the most requested features from our community!
